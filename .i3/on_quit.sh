#! /usr/bin/env bash

# This script serves three purposes:
# - kill iftops that were running in urxvtc windows, because they will load
#   100% of CPUs after losing their consoles (they were launched with sudo,
#   remember?) There is no cure.
# - gracefully kill firefox (and other apps), that were started from
#   startup_apps array in ~/.i3/autostart.sh. If firefox altered files
#   with private data, he needs some time to check it and ask confirmation
#   if the altered data seem to have lower size then one loaded at the start.
#   Earlier versions had problems and wiped the files, so I had to git checkout
#   them back.
# - erase /tmp/decrypted before exit, to be sure none of decrypted files are
#   left when Iâ€™m not by the computer.
