# Quick dirty little note from /etc/inputrc:
#  To get the key sequence for binding, you can abuse bash.
#  While running bash, hit CTRL+V, and then type the key sequence.
#  So, typing 'ALT + left arrow' in Konsole gets you back:
#    ^[[1;3D
#  The readline entry to make this skip back a word will then be:
#    "\e[1;3D" backward-word

"\eh": beginning-of-line
"\e\'": end-of-line
"\el": forward-char
"\ej": backward-char
"\e\"": forward-word
"\eH": backward-word

# as ‘delete’ key does
#"\e[3~": delete-char
# and this is as ‘backspace’
"\e;": backward-delete-char

"\C-Z": revert-line

## Refer to command line n.
# !n     
## Refer to the current command minus n.
# !-n    
## Refer to the previous command.  This is a synonym for `!-1'.
# !!     
## Refer to the most recent command preceding the current position in the history list starting with string.
# !string
## Refer to the most recent command preceding the current postition in the history list containing string.
## The trailing ? may be omitted if string is followed  immediately by a newline.
# !?string[?]
## Quick substitution.  Repeat the previous command, replacing string1 with string2.  
## Equivalent to ``!!:s/string1/string2/'' (see Modifiers below).
# ^string1^string2^
## The entire command line typed so far.
